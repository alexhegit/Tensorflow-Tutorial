    "   TensorFlow is open source Machine Learning library introduced by Google in 2015. Initially it was made for Google internal use by Google Brain team but in 2015 it has made open source. It is a high performance computation library and heavily used by the developers and researchers throughout the world.It has very flexible architecture which allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms CPUs, GPUs, TPUs and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.<br>\n",
